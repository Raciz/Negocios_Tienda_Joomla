For safety reasons it is very important to create a folder in a path not accessible by an URL or unguessable name, create also a folder 'invoices' and 'keys' in it to store your sensitive data secure. Our suggested path is for your system '/var/www/vmfiles/'. <br>You can also use complex folder name as 'password' for example '/var/www/html/administrator/components/com_virtuemart/7tE9ifFv4T1c/'.
